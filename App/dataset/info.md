- Jaundice: Jaundice is a medical condition characterized by yellowing of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes due to elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood. It is a sign of liver dysfunction or other underlying health issues.

- Epigastric pain: This refers to a type of abdominal pain or discomfort located in the upper central part of the abdomen, known as the epigastrium. It can be associated with various gastrointestinal and abdominal issues.

- WBC (White Blood Cell): White blood cells are a vital component of the immune system. This variable likely measures the count or concentration of white blood cells in the blood, which can indicate the presence of infection or inflammation.

- RBC (Red Blood Cells): Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. This variable might measure the count or characteristics of red blood cells, which can provide information about anemia or other blood-related conditions.

- HGB (Hemoglobin): Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that binds to oxygen and carries it to tissues. HGB levels are often measured to assess a person's oxygen-carrying capacity and can be used to diagnose anemia or other blood disorders.

- Plat (Platelets): Platelets are small cell fragments involved in blood clotting. Platelet counts are essential for assessing bleeding and clotting disorders.

- AST 1 (Aspartate Transaminase Ratio): AST is an enzyme found in the liver and other organs. This variable, AST 1, likely refers to the initial measurement of aspartate transaminase, which can be used to evaluate liver function and health.

- ALT 1 (Alanine Transaminase Ratio 1 week): ALT is another enzyme found in the liver. ALT 1 represents the measurement of alanine transaminase after one week, which may help monitor liver function over time.

- ALT 4, ALT 12, ALT 24, ALT 36, ALT 48 (Alanine Transaminase Ratios at different weeks): These variables represent measurements of alanine transaminase at various time points (4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks) in a medical study or treatment regimen, indicating how the liver is responding over time.

- RNA Base: This variable likely refers to the baseline measurement of RNA (genetic material) in a study or patient's sample.

- RNA 4, RNA 12 (RNA 4 and RNA 12): These variables represent measurements of RNA at different time points (4 and 12 weeks) in a study or treatment regimen, indicating how the RNA levels change over time.

- RNA EOT (RNA End-of-Treatment): This variable represents the measurement of RNA levels at the end of a treatment or study, showing the impact of the treatment on RNA.

- RNA EF (RNA Elongation Factor): This variable could refer to a specific RNA measurement related to an elongation factor, which is a protein involved in the process of RNA synthesis.

- Baseline histological Grading: This variable relates to the initial grading of the histological characteristics (microscopic tissue features) of a tissue sample, often used in assessing the severity or progression of a disease.

- Baseline histological staging: Similar to histological grading, this variable likely refers to the initial staging of the histological characteristics of a tissue sample, which helps determine the extent and severity of a disease, particularly in conditions like cancer.
